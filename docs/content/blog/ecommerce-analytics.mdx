If you run an e-commerce website, understanding your customer behavior and sales funnel is crucial for growth. Whether you're running a small online store or a large marketplace, having the right analytics in place can mean the difference between scaling successfully and struggling to understand why your sales are declining.

This is where Rybbit Analytics comes in. Unlike traditional analytics platforms that overwhelm you with data you don't need, Rybbit gives you actionable insights into your e-commerce metrics while respecting your customers' privacy and keeping your data under your control.

## Why E-commerce Sites Need Better Analytics

Most e-commerce platforms come with basic built-in analytics, but they're often limited in scope. You might see how many people visited your product pages, but can you easily answer these critical questions:

- Which marketing channels are actually driving purchases, not just traffic?
- What's the conversion rate for mobile vs desktop users?
- Are customers from certain countries more likely to complete a purchase?
- Which product pages have high traffic but low conversion rates?
- How is your site's performance affecting your sales?
- What's the customer journey from landing to checkout?

Traditional analytics tools like Google Analytics can answer some of these questions, but they come with significant downsides: complex setup, privacy concerns, cookie consent banners, data ownership issues, and an overwhelming interface that requires training to navigate effectively.

## What Makes Rybbit Different for E-commerce

Rybbit is built from the ground up to be simple, privacy-focused, and actionable. Here's what that means for your e-commerce business:

**No Cookie Consent Banners Required** - Rybbit doesn't use cookies, which means you don't need those annoying cookie banners that hurt your conversion rates. Your checkout flow stays clean and simple.

**Lightning Fast** - The Rybbit script is incredibly lightweight (under 1KB), so it won't slow down your product pages or checkout process. Every millisecond of load time matters for e-commerce conversions.

**You Own Your Data** - With the self-hosted option, all your customer data stays on your servers. No third-party access, no data sharing, complete control.

**Simple, Actionable Metrics** - Rybbit focuses on the metrics that actually matter for e-commerce, without drowning you in vanity metrics.

## Setting Up Rybbit for Your E-commerce Site

Getting started with Rybbit is straightforward. You can either use the hosted version or self-host it (which many e-commerce businesses prefer for data sovereignty).

### Installation

Add the Rybbit tracking script to your site's header. For most e-commerce platforms, this goes in your theme's template file:

```html
<script defer src="https://your-rybbit-instance.com/script.js" data-project-id="your-project-id"></script>
```

That's it. No complex configuration, no tag managers required, no cookies to configure.

### Tracking E-commerce Events

While Rybbit automatically tracks page views, you'll want to track key e-commerce events like:

- Product views
- Add to cart
- Checkout initiated
- Purchase completed

Here's how you track a purchase:

```javascript
rybbit.event("Purchase", {
  value: orderTotal,
  currency: "USD",
  transaction_id: orderId,
});
```

## Key Metrics for E-commerce Success

### 1. Traffic Sources and Quality

Understanding where your traffic comes from is table stakes, but Rybbit makes it easy to see which sources actually convert.

Using Rybbit's channel filter, you can quickly see traffic from:

- Organic search
- Paid advertising
- Social media
- Email campaigns
- Direct traffic
- Referrals

But more importantly, you can combine this with your purchase events to see which channels drive actual revenue, not just visits. This helps you allocate your marketing budget more effectively.

### 2. Geographic Performance

If you're selling internationally, geographic data is crucial. Rybbit makes it easy to analyze performance by country.

You can use geographic filtering to:

- Identify high-converting markets worth investing in
- Spot countries with high traffic but low conversion (maybe you need better shipping options or payment methods)
- Optimize your ad spend by focusing on profitable regions
- Plan inventory and shipping logistics based on where your customers are

### 3. Device and Platform Analysis

E-commerce conversion rates often vary significantly between desktop and mobile. Rybbit lets you filter by device type to understand these differences.

Common insights you might discover:

- Mobile traffic is high but conversion is low → your mobile checkout might need work
- Tablet users have higher average order values → consider tablet-specific promotions
- Desktop users browse more pages before purchasing → optimize your navigation for desktop

### 4. Page Performance Analysis

Page speed directly impacts e-commerce conversions. Studies show that even a 100ms delay can reduce conversion rates by 7%.

<img src="/blog/performancedashboard.png" alt="Rybbit's performance dashboard" />

Rybbit's performance tab shows you the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) for each page. If your product pages or checkout pages have high LCP times, you're losing money. The performance dashboard makes it easy to identify which pages need optimization.

**What to look for:**

- Product pages with high traffic but slow load times → optimize images, reduce scripts
- Checkout pages with performance issues → this is costing you direct sales
- Category pages that load slowly → customers will bounce before seeing your products

### 5. Conversion Funnel Insights

One of the most powerful uses of Rybbit for e-commerce is tracking your conversion funnel. Using the pages tab, you can see the customer journey:

<img src="/blog/pages.png" alt="Rybbit's page tab" />

The embedded graphs make it easy to spot where customers are dropping off:

- High traffic to product pages but low "add to cart" pages → product pages need better CTAs
- Many add to cart events but few checkout initiations → shipping costs revealed too late?
- Checkout started but not completed → payment issues or complicated forms?

### 6. Time-Based Patterns

Understanding when your customers shop helps you optimize promotions and advertising.

Using Rybbit's date range filters, you can:

- Compare this month vs last month to track growth
- Identify seasonal patterns in your business
- See if your recent marketing campaigns are working
- Spot unusual drops or spikes that need investigation

### 7. Referrer Analysis

Beyond broad traffic sources, Rybbit lets you drill down into specific referrers to see exactly which sites, influencers, or affiliate partners are driving traffic.

This is especially valuable for:

- Affiliate programs - see which affiliates drive the most valuable traffic
- Influencer marketing - track which influencers actually drive sales
- Content marketing - identify which guest posts or mentions are worth pursuing
- Partner relationships - measure the value of co-marketing efforts

## Real-World E-commerce Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Optimizing Marketing Spend

Sarah runs a sustainable fashion e-commerce store. She was spending $5,000/month on Facebook ads and $3,000/month on Google Ads. Using Rybbit's channel filtering combined with purchase events, she discovered:

- Facebook ads drove more traffic but had a 0.8% conversion rate
- Google Shopping ads had less traffic but a 3.2% conversion rate
- Organic search had the highest conversion rate at 4.1%

**Action taken:** She shifted budget from Facebook to Google Shopping and invested in SEO. Three months later, her overall conversion rate increased by 47% while her ad spend decreased by 25%.

### Scenario 2: Fixing Mobile Conversion Issues

Mike's electronics store had 65% mobile traffic but only 20% of purchases came from mobile devices. Using Rybbit's device filter and page analysis, he discovered:

- Mobile users were dropping off at the checkout page
- The checkout page had an LCP of 4.2 seconds on mobile (anything over 2.5 seconds is poor)
- Mobile users were bouncing at a 72% rate from the payment page

**Action taken:** Mike optimized his mobile checkout, reduced the number of form fields, improved page speed, and added mobile payment options like Apple Pay. Mobile conversion rate increased from 1.1% to 2.8%.

### Scenario 3: International Expansion

Jessica's beauty products store was primarily US-focused but noticed growing international traffic. Using Rybbit's geographic filtering, she found:

- UK traffic had high engagement and good conversion rates
- German traffic was significant but had a 0.3% conversion rate
- Australian visitors had the highest average order value

**Action taken:** She added localized payment options for Germany (SEPA), improved international shipping information, and added UK and Australian pricing. International sales increased by 134% in the next quarter.

### Scenario 4: Product Page Optimization

Tom's sporting goods store had great traffic but declining conversion rates. Using Rybbit's pages tab, he analyzed individual product pages and found:

- High-traffic product pages often had the worst conversion rates
- Pages with detailed descriptions and multiple images converted better
- Video demonstrations on product pages showed significantly higher conversion

**Action taken:** He prioritized improving the top-traffic, low-conversion product pages first, adding better images, detailed specifications, and customer reviews. Overall conversion rate improved by 22%.

## Privacy and E-commerce: Why It Matters

E-commerce businesses collect sensitive customer data - names, addresses, payment information. Using privacy-respecting analytics like Rybbit sends a positive signal to customers:

**No Data Sharing** - Customer behavior data stays with you, never sold to advertisers

**GDPR and Privacy Compliant** - Rybbit is built to respect privacy laws by default

**No Cookie Banners** - Better user experience means better conversion rates

**Build Trust** - Privacy-conscious customers appreciate businesses that respect their data

In an era where data breaches make headlines regularly, being able to tell your customers that you use privacy-first analytics is a competitive advantage.

## Advanced E-commerce Tracking with Rybbit

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Tracking

Track repeat purchases to understand customer lifetime value:

```javascript
// Track first purchase
rybbit.event("First Purchase", {
  value: orderTotal,
  customer_id: customerId,
});

// Track repeat purchases
rybbit.event("Repeat Purchase", {
  value: orderTotal,
  customer_id: customerId,
  purchase_count: totalPurchases,
});
```

### Cart Abandonment Analysis

Track when users add items to cart but don't complete checkout:

```javascript
// Add to cart
rybbit.event("Add to Cart", {
  product_id: productId,
  value: productPrice,
});

// Checkout started
rybbit.event("Checkout Started", {
  cart_value: totalValue,
});

// Purchase completed (or not)
rybbit.event("Purchase", {
  value: orderTotal,
});
```

By tracking these events, you can calculate your cart abandonment rate and work to reduce it.

### Product Category Performance

Track which product categories perform best:

```javascript
rybbit.event("Product View", {
  category: "Electronics",
  subcategory: "Headphones",
  product_id: productId,
});
```

This helps you understand which categories drive the most engagement and sales, informing your inventory and marketing decisions.
