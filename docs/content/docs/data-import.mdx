The data import feature allows you to migrate your historical analytics data from other platforms to Rybbit. This preserves your analytics history when switching from competitors, giving you a complete view of your data without losing valuable insights.

<Callout type="info">
  Data import is available on Standard and Pro plans. Free tier users will need to upgrade to access this feature.
</Callout>

## Supported Platforms

Currently, Rybbit supports importing data from:

- Umami
- Simple Analytics

Additional platforms may be added in the future based on user demand.

## Plan Requirements

### Cloud Version

| Plan | Access | Historical Window | Monthly Event Limit |
|------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Free | ❌ Not available | - | - |
| Standard | ✅ Available | 24 months | Plan limit applies |
| Pro | ✅ Available | 60 months (5 years) | Plan limit applies |
| AppSumo | ✅ Available | 24 months | Plan limit applies |

### Self-Hosted Version

Self-hosted installations have **unlimited** access to data imports with no restrictions on:
- Historical data window (import data from any date)
- Event quotas (no monthly limits)
- Concurrent imports (no limit on active imports)

## Import Limits

### Historical Data Windows

The historical data window determines how far back you can import data:

- **Standard/AppSumo plans**: Import data from the past 24 months
- **Pro plans**: Import data from the past 60 months (5 years)
- **Self-hosted**: Unlimited - import data from any date

Events outside your plan's historical window will be automatically skipped during import.

### Event Quotas

Imported events count toward your monthly event limit:

- If you're close to your monthly limit, imports may be partially skipped
- Skipped events are counted and displayed in the import history
- Consider upgrading your plan if you need to import large amounts of data

### Concurrent Imports

For cloud users:
- **Maximum 1 active import per organization**
- New imports are blocked until the current one completes
- Maximum 2-hour timeout per import

Self-hosted users have no concurrent import restrictions.

</Step>

<Step>

</Step>

<Step>

<Callout type="warn">
  For very large imports (multiple GB), consider splitting your CSV into smaller files and importing them sequentially.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Monitor Import Progress

Your import will begin processing in the background. You can:
- View the import status in the "Import History" section
- Monitor the number of imported, skipped, and invalid events
- Continue using Rybbit while the import runs

<Callout type="info">
  Large imports may take several minutes to complete. The page will automatically refresh to show updated progress.
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Import History

The Import History section displays all your past and current imports.

### Import Metrics

Each import shows three key metrics:

**Imported Events**
- Number of events successfully imported into Rybbit
- These events are now visible in your analytics dashboard

**Skipped Events**
- Events that were excluded during import
- Common reasons:
  - Outside your plan's historical data window
  - Would exceed your monthly event quota

**Invalid Events**
- Events that failed validation during import
- Common reasons:
  - Malformed CSV data
  - Missing required fields
  - Invalid date/time formats
  - Data type mismatches

<Callout type="warn">
  If you see a high number of invalid events, verify your CSV export matches the expected format for your platform.
</Callout>

### Managing Imports

**Deleting Completed Imports**
- Click the trash icon next to any completed import
- Confirm the deletion in the dialog
- This will permanently remove the import record **and all associated events** from your analytics
- Active imports cannot be deleted

<Callout type="error">
  Deleting an import removes all events that were imported. This action cannot be undone. Make sure you have a backup of your original CSV file.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Events Skipped Due to Quota Limits

**Cause:** Importing the events would exceed your monthly event limit.

**Solution:**
- Wait until the next billing cycle when your quota resets
- Upgrade to a plan with a higher event limit
- Import smaller date ranges to stay within quota

### Events Skipped Due to Date Range

**Cause:** Events are older than your plan's historical data window.

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to Pro plan for 60-month history (vs 24-month on Standard)
- For self-hosted, no action needed - all dates are allowed
- Filter your CSV export to only include recent data

### High Invalid Event Count

**Cause:** CSV format doesn't match the expected structure for your platform.

**Solution:**
1. Verify you selected the correct platform
2. Check that your CSV export includes all required fields
3. Look for special characters or malformed data in the CSV
4. Try importing a small sample file (first 100 rows) to test

### Import Appears Stuck

**Cause:** Very large files can take time to process, or a timeout occurred.

**Solution:**
- Wait up to 2 hours for the import to complete
- If still stuck after 2 hours, the import will be automatically marked as complete
- Check the imported event count to see if any data was processed
- Contact support if no events were imported

## Best Practices

### Before You Import

1. **Export a complete backup** from your current analytics platform
2. **Test with a small sample** (first 1,000 rows) before importing your full dataset
3. **Check your event quota** to ensure you have sufficient capacity
4. **Verify date ranges** match your plan's historical window
5. **Review CSV format** matches the required structure for your platform

### During Import

1. **Don't close the browser tab**
2. **Monitor the progress** in the Import History section
3. **Check for skipped/invalid events** early to catch format issues
4. **Wait for completion** before starting another import (cloud users)

### After Import

1. **Verify your data** appears correctly in analytics dashboards
2. **Check date ranges** to ensure historical data is visible
3. **Compare totals** with your source platform to validate accuracy
4. **Keep the original CSV** as a backup before deleting the import
